<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glow Discharge Spectrometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>dc-GDMS</li><li>rf-GDMS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Glow Discharge Spectrometer (GDMS) is used for analyzing the composition of solid materials. There are two main types: Direct Current Glow Discharge Mass Spectrometer (dc-GDMS) and Radio Frequency Glow Discharge Mass Spectrometer (rf-GDMS). </p><p>In dc-GDMS, a direct current is applied to the sample causing it to emit a glow discharge. This helps in analyzing the elemental composition of the material. </p><p>In rf-GDMS, a radio frequency is used instead of a direct current to create the glow discharge, providing more control and precision in the analysis process.</p></p>
