<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inkjet Card Printer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermal Foaming</li><li>Micro Piezo</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Inkjet card printers come in different types such as Thermal Foaming and Micro Piezo. Thermal Foaming printers use heat to create bubbles in the ink, which then expands onto the card surface. On the other hand, Micro Piezo printers use tiny electrically-charged nozzles to precisely control the ink droplets onto the card. Both technologies offer high-quality printing results, but the choice between them depends on factors such as cost, volume of printing, and desired print resolution.</p></p>
