<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ToF Image Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct ToF Sensors</li><li>Indirect ToF Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>ToF image sensor market can be classified into two types â€“ Direct ToF Sensors and Indirect ToF Sensors. Direct ToF Sensors directly measure the time it takes for light to travel from the sensor to the object and back, providing accurate depth sensing capabilities. On the other hand, Indirect ToF Sensors estimate depth by analyzing the phase shift of the reflected light, which may not be as precise as direct sensors but is more suitable for certain applications like gesture recognition and 3D mapping.</p></p>
