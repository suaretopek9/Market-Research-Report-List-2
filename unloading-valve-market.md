<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Unloading Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pass-through Type</li><li>Unloading Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pass-through Type unloading valves allow fluid flow to pass through the valve when the set pressure is reached, diverting the fluid to a separate line. This type is commonly used in systems where the fluid needs to be redirected to a different destination. On the other hand, Unloading Type unloading valves release the excess pressure by diverting the fluid back to the reservoir, preventing damage to the system. This type is ideal for applications where pressure relief is crucial to prevent system failure.</p></p>
