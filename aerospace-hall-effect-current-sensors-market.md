<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aerospace Hall Effect Current Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open-Loop</li><li>Closed-Loop</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aerospace Hall Effect Current Sensors are classified into two types: Open-Loop and Closed-Loop. In the Open-Loop market, the sensor directly measures the magnetic field generated by the current passing through the conductor without any feedback mechanism. On the other hand, in the Closed-Loop market, the sensor measures the magnetic field and uses a feedback mechanism to adjust its output for accurate current measurement. Open-Loop sensors are simpler and more cost-effective, while Closed-Loop sensors offer higher accuracy and stability.</p></p>
